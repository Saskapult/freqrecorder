# FreqRecorder
It makes csv files with iso8601-formatted time entries so I can track the frequency with which the sound "umm" is made during my lectures.
It can even make graphs of it!
Yes I know this is childish, but it is also quite fun.

This program is not indented to be used by anyone other than myself.
As such it is a complete mess.
I don't know what else to say.
